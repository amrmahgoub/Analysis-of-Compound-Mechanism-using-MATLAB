# Analysis-of-Compound-Mechanism-using-SIMULINK
I utilized Simulink to model the behavior of compound mechanisms. By implementing loop closure equations, I accurately estimated the position, velocity, and acceleration of the mechanisms. This approach allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the dynamic behavior and performance of the system.
